					<h2>About me:</h2> <br>
					<p> My name's Alondra Cruz-Delgado. I'm currently studying 
					Electrical and Computer engineering at UAlbany. My main interest is embedded systems 
					due to its blend of software and hardware requirements as well as the unique
					solutions that can be developed for any problem. I like to be engaged and prefer hands
					on learning which is why I made this website to not only display my talents, but also
					learn on the job!
